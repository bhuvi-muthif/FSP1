# Data Source
The data for this future sales prediction project was obtained from the XYZ Retail Company, which generously provided access to their historical sales records. The dataset can be found at [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chakradharmattapalli/future-sales-prediction] and is available for research and analysis purposes.

# Data Description
The dataset consists of the following key features:

Date: The date of each sales transaction.
Store ID: A unique identifier for each store.
Product ID: A unique identifier for each product.
Sales Quantity: The quantity of the product sold on a specific date.
Price: The price of the product on the date of sale.
Promotion Indicator: A binary indicator (0 or 1) representing whether a product was on promotion or not on the given date.
The data covers a period of several years, allowing us to analyze long-term sales trends and patterns. The dataset is comprehensive and includes a wide range of products sold across multiple stores, making it suitable for building predictive models.

# Data Preprocessing
Before utilizing the data for prediction, we conducted the following preprocessing steps:

Handling missing values: We addressed any missing data points by imputation or removal as appropriate.
Outlier detection: Outliers were identified and treated to ensure data integrity.
Feature engineering: We created additional features like day of the week, month, and year from the date variable to assist with modeling.
The preprocessed data was used for training and evaluating the predictive models.

This dataset serves as the foundation for our applied data science project, aiming to predict future sales for individual products in specific stores. The insights gained from this analysis can be used for inventory management, stock optimization, and informed decision-making within the retail company.
